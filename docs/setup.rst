Setting up ROBOTC
=================

Often times, ROBOTC will not already be configured and ready to use for the VEX 2.0 Cortex.
The process to set it up though is quite easy.

Switching the compiler to VEX 2.0 Cortex from VEX IQ
----------------------------------------------------

1. Click on **Robot** in the top menu bar
2. Click on **Platform Type**
3. Click on **VEX 2.0 Cortex**, you should notice the Text Functions menu on the side update to reflect this change.
